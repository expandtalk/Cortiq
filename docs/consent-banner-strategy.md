# Consent & Cookie Banner Strategy

Status: **DRAFT for approval** · Owner: Daniel · Last updated: 2026-07-07

Goal: raise banner acceptance and reduce how often the banner is even needed, strictly within GDPR / ePrivacy. The single biggest lever is making CortIQ's own analytics **consent-exempt**, which removes the "Statistics" toggle from the banner entirely. Everything else (copy, UX nudging, Consent Mode v2, platform features) sits on top of that.

This doc covers five areas. Each ends with a **Decision** to approve or change.

---

## 0. The hard constraint (why #1 is not just copy)

ePrivacy Art. 5(3) (LEK in Sweden) requires consent for **storing or reading information on the user's device** — not for measurement itself. The CNIL/EDPB audience-measurement exemption allows consent-free analytics only if **all** of these hold:

- no cross-site tracking,
- **no device fingerprinting**,
- **no persistent cross-visit identifier**,
- IP truncated / not stored raw,
- first-party only, purpose limited to aggregate statistics,
- any first-party identifier is short-lived (session), not used to recognise the visitor on later visits.

**CortIQ does not meet this today.** From the code:

- `visitor-identification` builds a **device fingerprint** (SHA-256 of UA + screen + timezone + language + platform + canvas + WebGL) using a **static per-site salt** (`sites.fingerprint_salt`), and upserts `unified_visitors` to recognise **returning visitors** across visits.
- `spa-tracking.js` persists a visitor/session UUID client-side.

Fingerprinting + cross-visit identity are exactly what the exemption forbids. So "measure without a banner" is a real engineering mode, not a wording change. The dashboard copy ("cookie-free") already contradicts the implementation ("user agent fingerprints") — same root cause.

## 1. Cookieless / consent-exempt mode  (the lever)

Introduce **two explicit modes**, selectable per site in the WP plugin and in the CortIQ API (`sites` row):

### Mode A — Cookieless (consent-exempt)  ← recommended default
- **No device fingerprint.** Skip canvas/WebGL/UA fingerprinting.
- **No cross-visit identity.** No `unified_visitors` recognition across visits.
- **Daily-rotating salt** (Plausible/Fathom model): the server derives a per-day visitor hash = `SHA-256(daily_salt || truncated_IP || UA)` used only to count **unique visitors within that day**. The salt rotates at midnight and old salts are discarded, so the same person cannot be linked across days. Raw IP never stored.
- **No persistent client storage.** Session grouping uses an in-memory, per-tab id (lost on tab close). No localStorage, no cookie.
- Result: heatmaps (grid-snapped), scroll depth, pageviews, sessions-within-a-visit, AI-bot detection (UA-based, not personal) all still work in aggregate.
- **The "Statistics" category disappears from the banner.** Only GA4 + Marketing remain consent-gated.

### Mode B — Full (consent-gated)
- Current behaviour: fingerprint + returning-visitor identity + engagement-over-time. Requires the Statistics consent toggle. For customers who explicitly want visitor-level analytics and accept the banner cost.

### What Mode A loses vs Mode B
- Returning-visitor / new-vs-returning splits, engagement scores over time, visitor-level journeys across sessions/days.
- Keeps: traffic volume, top pages, referrers, heatmaps, scroll depth, sessions within a visit, unique-per-day counts, AI-bot/agent intelligence.

### Legal framing (important)
We describe the **technical basis** ("no device storage, no fingerprint, daily-rotating salt, IP truncated, aggregate only") and let the operator conclude. We do **not** print a categorical "no consent required under GDPR" — that's the customer's legal call, and it's a liability to assert it for them. This also fixes the dashboard-copy issue.

### Touch points
`spa-tracking.js` (skip identify + no client storage in Mode A), `visitor-identification` (stripped/daily-hash path), `track-event`/`ingest_pageview` (daily unique key), `sites` schema (`tracking_mode` column + `daily_salt` rotation), banner category rendering.

**Decision 1:** Approve two modes with **Cookieless as the default**? Or default Full and offer Cookieless as opt-in?

---

## 2. i18n + value-based copy

- **WP plugin:** read `get_locale()`, a flat PHP string table keyed by `sv_SE` / `en_US` / `de_DE` (default English), plus an admin dropdown: **Auto (WP locale) / English / Svenska / Deutsch**. Localise banner text + category names/descriptions.
- **JS snippet (Next/Astro):** `config.locale` + a JS string table; default from `navigator.language`.
- **Copy:** value-based, not legalistic. e.g. *"Hjälp oss förstå vad läsarna gillar"* over *"Helps us understand how visitors use the site"*. Short first layer, details behind "Visa detaljer" (already built).
- Keep it a **flat dictionary** — adding a language = adding a key. No i18n framework for 3 languages. `store-consent` already logs `locale` for the audit trail.

**Decision 2:** English default, ship sv + en + de now, structured for more. OK?

---

## 3. GDPR-safe banner UX nudge

Allowed and effective:
- **Modal/overlay** instead of a discrete corner banner (raises interaction rate). No **cookie wall** (blocking content is not allowed).
- **Prominent "Accept all"** next to a **clearly readable "Only necessary"** — both in the first layer. What gets banners struck down is a missing reject in the first layer, grey-on-grey text, or more clicks to reject than to accept. Contrast colour itself is fine (EDPB taskforce did not fault it).
- **Don't re-ask on rejection for 6–12 months**; renew consent by ~13 months. Constant re-prompting is a dark pattern.
- **Consent-level reopen icon states:** calm/filled at full accept, a subtle badge/tone at necessary-only — a soft invitation to reconsider. **No pulsing, blinking, or red-dot notifications** (manipulative, annoys more than it converts).

**Decision 3:** Go modal + prominent-accept + 12-month re-ask + subtle icon states?

---

## 4. GA4 & third-party tools — Consent Mode v2

- **Consent Mode v2** (required by Google since Mar 2024 for EEA ad traffic). Emit `gtag('consent','default',{ad_storage:'denied',analytics_storage:'denied',ad_user_data:'denied',ad_personalization:'denied'})` **before** GA4 loads; update to `granted` when the visitor accepts Statistics/Marketing.
  - **Basic** (GA4 not loaded until consent — cleanest legally, most data loss) vs **Advanced** (cookieless pings + Google modelling — grey zone). **Default Basic**, let the customer opt into Advanced.
  - Note: the plugin currently outputs GA4 with **no** consent gating — this is a real gap to close.
- **Per-integration category mapping** (hard-coded): GA4 / Clarity / Hotjar → Statistics; Google Ads / Meta / TikTok → Marketing; GTM → warn (black box). 
- **Technical blocking, not promises:** unconsented third-party scripts must be `type="text/plain"` and rewritten to active on consent — not merely "we won't fire events".
- **Withdraw as easy as accept:** the reopen icon covers this. Be honest that we can delete first-party cookies via JS but can only stop *loading* third-party domains' cookies, not delete them.
- **Conservative GA4 defaults + checklist** when a customer connects GA4: EU data location, IP anonymisation (now automatic), no Google Signals, 2-month retention. "GA4 configured as EU-safe as possible" is a sales point.

**Decision 4:** Consent Mode v2 with Basic default + technical script blocking + category mapping?

## 5. CortIQ platform features (build after 1–4)

- **Geo-gating:** show the banner only in EEA/UK/CH via `CF-IPCountry` (already read in `_shared/jurisdiction.ts`) + a server-side API flag; implied/no banner elsewhere. Legitimate. Low impact on primarily-Swedish traffic, but valuable for international customers — build as a platform feature, don't expect movement on itsäkerhet.com.
- **Integration risk badges** (Low/Medium/High) by out-of-EU transfer, cookie lifetime, sensitivity. GA4 = Medium (US transfer), CortIQ own = Low/None. Turns the hub into a compliance tool.
- **Live "Cookie banner preview"** in the Integration Hub — toggling an integration shows the banner change. Visually ties "fewer tools = simpler banner = higher acceptance".
- **Dashboard "Setup health check"** (top of Overview): script active ✓ / GDPR mode ✓ / consent log ✓ / GA4 with Consent Mode ✓, green-yellow-red.
- **Consent Impact view** (the killer feature): banner acceptance rate + CortIQ (all visitors) vs GA4 (consented only) gap — *"GA4 misses X% of your traffic"*. **Only legitimate once Mode A ships** (otherwise we'd be measuring fingerprinted visitors without consent). Also enables real A/B testing of banner colour/copy.

**Decision 5:** Build order within #5 — start with risk badges + health check (fast, high trust), then Consent Impact (after Mode A), then geo + preview?

---

## 6. Security / hygiene (cross-cutting, task #7)

- **Standardise the script host on `cortiq.se`** everywhere (no loading tracking from itsäkerhet.com etc. — looks off in customers' network logs).
- Confirm **no real API keys** render in the setup view / doc examples (tracking IDs + Supabase URL are public by design; keys are not).
- **Origin/site_id defense-in-depth** on ingest endpoints to reduce junk on others' tracking IDs. Rate-limiting per `site_id` already exists (`check_rate_limit`); RLS already on.

---

## Recommended sequence

1. **Cookieless mode** (unlocks the banner simplification, the Consent Impact view, and "measure without a banner").
2. **i18n + copy** (parallel, cheap).
3. **Banner UX nudge** (modal, prominent accept).
4. **Consent Mode v2** for GA4.
5. **Platform features** (risk badges + health check → Consent Impact → geo + preview).

Security hygiene (#6) folds into whichever plugin/dashboard work touches those files.
